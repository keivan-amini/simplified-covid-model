# Simplified COVID-19 epidemiological model & City mobility analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the codes for the project of the courses [Physics of Complex systems](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/433619) and [Physical Methods of Biology](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/433617) for the curriculum of Applied Physics at the University of Bologna.

Files on the repository:
- ```model.py``` code for the simulation of a COVID-19 pandemic wave according to a distributed delay, six compartment SIR model;
- ```rilevazione-autoveicoli-tramite-spire-anno-2020_header_mod.csv``` dataset regarding the autoveichles mobility in the city of Bologna during 2020, offered by [Open Data Bologna](https://opendata.comune.bologna.it/pages/home/);
- ```mobility-analysis.py``` code used to analyze the dataset;
- ```mappa1080.png``` a 1517x1080 map of the city of Bologna.
